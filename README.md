# tinyEmbeddingsEngine
This engine provides the methods to deal with semantic word vectors. Basicly, it is a storage for the embedding matrix and the related vocabulary. It can (but is not now) 
* find similar word fast 
* compute the cosine similarity 
* produce embeddings for more complicated structure of text. 

It will be included in search engine.
